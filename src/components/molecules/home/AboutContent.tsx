          I specialize in front-end technologies like React.js and Next.js,
          paired with CSS frameworks such as Tailwind CSS to build responsive
          and visually appealing interfaces. On the back end, I work with
          Node.js, Express.js, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB to
          develop secure and efficient APIs.

          and technical abilities have been sharpened. I am committed to writing

          prioritize staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to
          continually grow as a developer.
