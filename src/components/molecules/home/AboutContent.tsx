        Hello, iâ€™m Ikhsan!
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently improving my skills at Purwadhika Bootcamp, I am a Software
        Developer focused on building scalable, user-friendly applications. I
        used JavaScript library like React.js and Next.js Framework, paired with
        CSS frameworks such as Tailwind CSS for creating responsive interfaces.
        On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express.js, and databases like
        PostgreSQL and MongoDB to develop secure and efficient APIs.
        <br />
        <br />
        The experience of being a developer and administrator of a game server
        has honed my problem solving and technical abilities to the finer
        points. As a developer, I am passionate about writing clean,
        maintainable code, and thus, committed to building high-performance
        applications. I keep in touch with the latest technologies and trends in
        order to keep improving my expertise.
